# Draw Bot Encoding

Run the script and select a PNG image. It will encode it into many 280 (used to be 512) character long strings that can be copied into 
RecRoom, decoded and used in a CV2 image printer. 

If the image is not yet dithered, get the closes RecRoom color to every pixel. This results in a very flat looking image and fast print times due to the lack of dithering. It is suggested that you use external programs for color conversion and dithering as my current method takes a minute and produces mediocre results. I suggest Photoshop (using included ACO files) or gimp.

CV2 image printer room and the rest of the scripts will be published very soon under the name ^ImagePrinterBot
